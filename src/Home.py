    ## Welcome to Value Screening Tools!

    This tool is designed to help you screen stocks based on specific value investing criteria using Macrotrends data. Here's a brief overview of what you can do.

    ### Key Features:
    
    - **Stock Screener**: Filter stocks based on criteria like price-to-book (P/B) and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, years of positive P/B & P/E history, and more.
    - **Price & Time Checker**: Analyze stocks based on debt levels over different holding periods.

    ### How to Use:
    
    ðŸ‘ˆ Select a page from the sidebar to get started. You are currently on the **Home** page, but you can select from the **Screener** and **Price & Time Checker** pages.
